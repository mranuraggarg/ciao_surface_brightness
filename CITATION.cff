abstract: >
  This repository provides a complete Python-based analysis pipeline to extract and model the surface brightness profile
  of the galaxy cluster A2163 using Chandra ACIS-I data. It includes CIAO preprocessing, dmextract radial profile generation,
  and Sherpa model fitting using a normalized Î²-model and Gaussian component. Outputs include best-fit model plots, residuals,
  and a LaTeX report. This project enables reproducible astrophysical analysis of galaxy cluster X-ray emission.
